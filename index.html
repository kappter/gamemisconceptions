"Software development is only about writing code.","Software development involves planning, design, testing, debugging, collaboration, and maintenance."
"Developers don't need people skills.","Collaboration, communication, and teamwork are essential in software development."
"One programming language is better than all others.","Different languages are suited for different tasks; no single one is universally superior."
"Adding more developers always speeds up a project.","According to Brooks' Law, adding manpower to a late project often makes it later due to communication overhead."
"Software developers are interchangeable resources.","Developers have unique skills, experiences, and expertise that make them non-interchangeable."
"Software engineering is the same as software development.","Software engineering includes structured processes, methodologies, and best practices beyond just coding."
"Only big tech companies pay well in software development.","Many mid-sized companies, startups, and non-tech industries offer competitive salaries."
"Software development is quick and easy.","It's a complex, iterative process that requires time, problem-solving, and adaptation."
"Programmers are antisocial and introverted.","Many developers are outgoing and thrive in team environments; personality varies widely."
"Programming is boring and monotonous.","It involves creativity, innovation, and solving diverse challenges."
"Programming is only for geniuses or naturally gifted people.","Anyone can learn with dedication, practice, and the right resources."
"Women cannot code or are less capable in software development.","Women are equally capable and have made significant historical and modern contributions to the field."
"Anyone can code without formal training or effort.","Coding requires learning, practice, and ongoing skill development."
"All software development companies are the same.","Companies differ in culture, processes, expertise, and quality."
"Agile methodology means no planning is needed.","Agile involves iterative planning, feedback, and adaptation."
"More features always make a product better.","Quality, usability, and relevance matter more than quantity; over-featuring can complicate things."
"Good developers don't need documentation.","Documentation is crucial for maintainability, collaboration, and knowledge transfer."
"Software requirements are fully known upfront.","Requirements often evolve through discovery, feedback, and changes."
"Software development is a male-dominated field where men are inherently better.","Stereotypes and biases deter women, but women perform equally well and often better in certain aspects like code acceptance."
"Men contribute more to open-source software than women.","Studies show this stereotype is false; contributions vary by individual, not gender."
"Women in software development worry more about age discrimination than gender bias.","Both issues exist, but gender bias is a significant barrier."
"Girls are naturally less interested in computer science and engineering.","Societal stereotypes create this gap from an early age; interest is not innate."
"Women make up only a tiny percentage of the tech workforce, so they don't belong.","Women comprise about 25-27% of tech roles, and diversity efforts are increasing representation."
"Software development is a one-time expense.","It requires ongoing maintenance, updates, and support costs."
"IT projects are always prohibitively expensive.","Costs vary and can be justified by long-term value and ROI."
"Outsourcing software development always saves costs.","It depends on the project; sometimes in-house is better for control and quality."
"Custom software is always more expensive than off-the-shelf solutions.","Upfront costs may be higher, but custom solutions offer long-term savings and fit."
"Fixed-price contracts eliminate all financial risks.","Risks like scope changes or unforeseen issues still exist."
"Accurate cost estimation for software projects is impossible.","It's possible using historical data, expert input, and benchmarks."
"Maintenance costs in software should be minimized at all costs.","Focus on value; proper maintenance prevents larger future expenses."
"Software developers are all nerds with poor hygiene and social skills.","Developers are diverse individuals with varied lifestyles and personalities."
"Software engineers are born intelligent and don't need to learn.","Skills are acquired through education, practice, and experience."
"Software engineering jobs are boring and repetitive.","They involve dynamic problem-solving and innovation."
"Every software engineer knows everything about computers and tech.","Most specialize in specific areas like front-end, back-end, or DevOps."
"Software developers obsess over the latest gadgets and gear.","Some do, but many prioritize functionality over bleeding-edge tech."
"Developers always wear hoodies, jeans, and flip-flops.","Dress varies by company culture; many work in professional environments."
"Software engineers refuse to write documentation.","Professional developers recognize its importance and do it."
"All developers are addicted to caffeine.","It's common but not universal; habits vary."
"Software developers are mostly young people under 35.","The field includes professionals of all ages, with experience valued."
"Software engineers are mostly white or Caucasian males.","Diversity is increasing, though stereotypes persist; global talent is varied."
"Software developers have no work-life balance.","It depends on the company; many promote healthy boundaries."
"Software engineering is easy money with little effort.","It's competitive, requires hard work, and entry-level jobs can be tough to land."
"Developers always work long hours and overtime.","Hours vary; many companies emphasize sustainable paces."
"Software engineers are inherently lazy and avoid simple problems.","They tackle complex issues efficiently, but professionalism varies."
"Developers spend most of their time debugging, which is frustrating.","Debugging is a key part, but it's rewarding when solved."
"Code is self-documenting and doesn't need extra explanations.","Clear code helps, but separate documentation is essential for teams."
"In-house development is always preferable to outsourcing.","Outsourcing can provide expertise, scalability, and cost benefits."
"Software development is fast and features can be added easily later.","Changes later in the process are costly and time-consuming."`;
